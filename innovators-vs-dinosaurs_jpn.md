In December of last year, Leelah Alcorn, a young transgender girl,
committed suicide. It hit me as hard as if I had known her. I felt
connected to her. For a year, my focus has been on helping homeless
youth, and it was heartbreaking to hear that 40 percent of homeless
teens identify as LGBT. The more I learned about what life can be like
as a transgender person, the more I realized how especially woven into
homelessness that is. Acceptance is a huge step towards eradicating
youth homelessness. Being who you are and who you want to be has nothing
to do with gender, sexuality, body type, race, or age.

I haven’t been quiet or shy about discrimination issues towards the LGBT
community because by alienating people, it makes it harder to work, live
in society, have a home, have a family, and can result in homelessness.
I wanted to learn more about other challenges in the LGBT community,
like violence against transgender women, HIV/AIDS and family
condemnation. Anything beautiful on this planet takes time, and with
time comes change. That’s why I’m launching the Happy Hippie
Foundation — because every life is valuable and we should make sure
those who question their value feel protected.

Art starts as a blank canvas and has to be painted on by someone with a
vision to become a piece of art. We are our own canvases — we should be
free to create anything we want our lives to be!

The Happy Hippie Foundation is encouraging people to be the artists of a
picture of true freedom, freedom of self-expression… freedom to be true
to themselves. The fight to be free isn’t over. We have to rally
together and fight injustice. Being a happy hippie means making others
happy, even those unlike yourself! Happy Hippie Foundation isn’t just
focusing on one problem; I am young and there is so much to fight for,
learn, and be passionate about. Homeless youth and young people
experiencing the negative effects of being LGBT in our world today is an
issue that is very common and extremely current. I am honored to be a
part of this movement and living in a time to witness the revolution!
Bruce Jenner spoke beautifully about using his platform and fame to DO
GOOD and to make real change, and I want to do exactly that!

Change is what we need and what young people are counting on! Living a
life untrue to who you really are makes life unbearable for human beings
with feelings and emotions — like love, maybe the greatest one of them.
Pointless judgment and its consequences are unfortunately way too
common. All humans have valid feelings and rights!

No one should have to hide who they really are, no matter what his or
her name, gender, status or orientation. That’s why happy hippies are
here to say that every life is valuable and it is our mission to make
sure those who question the value of themselves and their lives feel
protected and loved by us… which they very much are.

Happy Hippie has raised and donated money so that homeless young people
at My Friend’s Place shelter in LA will receive food and clean socks and
underwear for the next two years. While clean socks and underwear seem
normal to us, they aren’t to the 1.6 million homeless young Americans
without them. They will also receive more than 60,000 meals and snacks.

The loyalty of animals and the freedom of art are huge parts of my life.
When brought into the homeless community, they are proven interventions
that help build skills and provide the emotional supports that help
homeless youth rebuild their lives. The best part of making art is that
there is no right or wrong. It is the expression of what we feel — a
freedom that has been taken away from so many of these young people. We
want to help give it back to them. Happy Hippie programs include the
supplies and equipment to encourage this self-expression. We are also
funding animal companion programs, which build health status and can
provide a loyal friend to those who need one most.

When we learned about the possibility to increase NY funding for
homeless youth to \$4.5 million, we wrote to Governor Cuomo, Speaker
Heastie, and Leader Skelos to support the move. My fans added their
support through an online petition, and the budget passed. We are making
big changes! Youth fighting for youth! Happy Hippie’s current project is
creating digital support groups that will simulate physical support
groups for LGBT youth. This will be a safe and moderated place that
utilizes technology so young people and their families can join in no
matter where they live.

This is just the beginning for me and Happy Hippie. Thousands have
joined our community and our fight for acceptance and justice for those
who aren’t getting it!

We are working with some of the top names in politics, technology, and
entertainment to build the world that we want to live in. I want to give
my fans a platform to learn about issues that they might not have
otherwise, a safe place to ask questions, a place to collaborate and
take action! There is a new generation about to take over and I hope
that we can create a happier and freer world to live in. We are all
still growing, learning, and evolving…. And so should our world. There
are billions of different people on this earth… and they all deserve to
be happy.
