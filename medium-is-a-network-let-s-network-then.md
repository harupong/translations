#### There’s been a very interesting meta-conversation on Medium going on recently. Roughly it falls into one of these two categories: {#b076 .graf--h4 .graf--first name="b076"}

1.  [What is Medium?](https://medium.com/@lotto/what-s-going-on-at-medium-www-buzzfeed-com-c4d47c4bff15) [A publishing tool or a network?](https://medium.com/the-story/medium-is-not-a-publishing-tool-4c3c63fa41d2) A place for the best thoughtfully crafted long-form, for expressing oneself in any way possible, for [people interacting in the context of written content](https://medium.com/@traceypharoah/is-medium-ready-to-embrace-social-change-e3c0474287c3), or maybe — all of those things? How to create a [community](https://medium.com/message/writing-on-medium-88a5e99d86c9?source=has-recommended) here?
2.  What is Medium’s role? Does it provide us with a cute editor and clean, distraction free design and we (writers) need to work for the exposure completely on our own? Or maybe Medium should [help us a little (or a lot)](https://medium.com/@saulofhearts/why-medium-needs-to-engage-the-middle-ground-7b02d4b7c921) to encourage writers who don’t have a big audience yet?

These two are of course connected in many ways. I am still not sure what Medium is, as I see it a work in progress — not only code-wise, as it also develops in public awareness.

#### Medium will be what we, the users, will do with it. {#8c92 .graf--h4 name="8c92"}

Personally, I enjoy most the “not necessarily long-form, but definitely thoughtful, important, interesting, why not funny, **content** PLUS an **interactive discussion**” vision. I am already addicted to Medium. It is the second place I go online in the morning (first is my email account, where I find the daily newsletter & usually can’t/won’t help myself but click on some interesting title), I read thoroughly 2–3 good articles a day and scan many more. Recently I’ve started to also fancy interaction. I write responses and they seem to receive more attention (recs & follows) than my “regular” posts, without me even lifting a finger after I wrote them. I get excited when I can add something, comment on, share my knowledge in responses or notes. It feels like **contribution**, not *just a comment*.

Yes, I wish my posts were getting more exposure. I have no brand, I don’t have a startup, I’m sometimes a little shy (didn’t have the balls to propose my work to any of the publications yet), but I’ll work my way to it, I know. I did that during the 9 years of writing a professional blog in my mother tongue. I can do it now. It would be great if Medium helped me with that, however, I feel the potential it gives me now.

#### What I do with this potential is my job only. {#c34f .graf--h4 name="c34f"}

My only fear is that posts which authors get paid (one way or another, hired by Medium itself or by their company), posts of known brands and of highly popular publications will push my stories off the main feed for my actual and potential followers. But well, this is how it works everywhere, doesn’t it?

So, my conclusion is: let’s do it.

Let’s push those recommend buttons and put that tiny effort to have a comment go with it. I jump with joy when someone does that with my stories.

Let’s create notes, to chime in, to appreciate a thought, to share one of our thoughts. *(Medium, could you please create a toggle button to open/collapse all the notes in a post at once, so that I don’t have to click my way through them?)*.

Let’s join the conversations, write responses, short or long.

Let’s make friends here! *(Medium, could you please add a direct messaging option, so I could write someone something like “hey, love your work, just wanted to let you know I’m happily following you from now on” or “hey, maybe we could collaborate?” Why send me to Twitter to do that?)*

Let’s share the stories we like, help other writers reach a wider audience, it doesn’t take much — press the share button, send it to Twitter or FB. We can help each other a lot, easily.

#### Let’s network, guys. {#9690 .graf--h4 .graf--last name="9690"}
